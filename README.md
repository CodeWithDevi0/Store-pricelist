# Family Mini Store Pricelist Web App

This is a simple web application I made for my family mini store. My parents can use this to check product prices easily. I also made this project to practice my programming skills.

## About Our Store App

I created this web application because we have a family store and my parents always need to check prices. Before this, they have to look through papers and notebooks to find prices. This was taking too much time. Now they can just type the product name and see the price immediately.

### What This App Can Do
- Search products by typing name
- Show prices right away when you search
- Works on phone and computer
- Simple design that is easy to use
- Loads fast so you don't wait

### Who Uses This App
- My parents use it in our store to check prices
- Customers can also use it to see prices
- I made it to learn more about programming

  product_name: 'New Product Name',
  product_price: 25.00
}
```

## Why I Made This

I made this because I want to help my parents with their store work. Also I want to practice programming and learn new things. It makes me happy that I can make something useful for my family and also improve my coding skills at same time.

This project is special for me because it helps my family and helps me learn programming together.
